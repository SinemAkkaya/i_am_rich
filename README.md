# 💎 I Am Rich - Flutter App

Back in the early days of the App Store, there was a legendary app called **"I Am Rich"** that was sold for $999.  
The only thing it did was show a shiny red gem — and 8 people actually bought it!

As a fun exercise while learning Flutter through Angela Yu’s course, I recreated this iconic app using **Flutter**.  
This project helped me understand the fundamentals of Flutter layout, widgets, and app structure.
